Upstream-Name: Joao Eriberto Mota Filho
Upstream-Contact: Joao Eriberto Mota Filho <eriberto@eriberto.pro.br>
Source: https://github.com/eribertomota/hello-destructor
Comment: The pristine upstream source contains obfuscated and binary files,
 that are thereby not appropriate for use as source files.
 This violates DFSG §2.
 .
 The ‘debian/repack’ program removes those files to create the Debian
 upstream source tarball.
